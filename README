# About WFPLSIU?

What f#&king programming language should I use? is a tounge-in-cheek guide to choosing a programming language. Inspired by the endless nerd battles online about the "best" programming language in any scenario, this app turns it into a joke so we can all have some fun and stop taking ourselves so seriously.

The app was built with Knockout.

You can visit the app at [WFPLSIU?](http://www.wfplsiu.com).
